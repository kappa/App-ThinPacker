App::ThinPacker is development tool that enables simple Perl scripts
to autoinstall their dependencies.

Usage:

	% thinpack your-script.pl > your-script-dist.pl
	%

your-script-dist.pl will first check if all needed dependencies are
installed and will try to install missing ones using built-in tiny
HTTP client.

thinpack-ed scripts are easy to distribute.

BUGS:
	No Windows support. Rudimentary parsing. Default --sudo for cpanm. Donwloading cpanminus from third-party source. Patches are welcome.
